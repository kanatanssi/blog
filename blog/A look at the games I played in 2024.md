Getting a Steam Deck helped me big time with discovering the joy of gaming and trying out different titles again. For the longest time I would simply stick to the few classics I knew and loved, but writing this list in early March, I have already touched upon more titles than I have in several past years combined.
- [[Transistor]], January
- [[Bastion]], January
- [[Deiland]], January-February
- [[Aegis Defenders]], February-, played co-op
- [[Pikuniku]], February
- [[Regions of Ruin]], February
- [[Kingdom]], February
- [[Europa Universalis]], again, like every year, February
- [[Surviving Mars]], March
