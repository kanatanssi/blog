Getting a Steam Deck helped me big time with discovering the joy of gaming and trying out different titles again. For the longest time I would simply stick to the few classics I knew and loved, but writing this list in early March, I have already touched upon more titles than I have in several past years combined.
### January
#### Transistor
#### Bastion
#### Deiland

An extreme jank experience, yet somehow very endearing. There is strong eurojank energy in this game, and together with its clear mobile gaming roots, the experience is something akin to a lovechild of Gothic 3 and Farmville.

### February
#### Aegis Defenders
#### Pikuniku
#### Regions of Ruin
I hope the unbalanced weapons and companions are by design, because it is probably the most prominent part of the experience, an the most fun. 
#### Kingdom
I liked the minimalistic look and gameplay of this one. There is a sense of discovery in learning how the enemies work, I would have wished the same for learning how the kingdom building goes - but I think the trial and error is the point here, given the subtitle "nothing lasts".
### March
#### Surviving Mars
This title was honestly a bit boring to me at first, and I did not feel like I was getting it... Yet somehow it drew me in. This game has its own charm, but feels in many ways unfinished. The game could benefit immensely from different options to automate things, letting the player build their infrastructure.

The limited amount of maps is also disappointing, having a truly randomly generated map would increase the replayability. Once you get the hang of it, getting over the initial stages of survival is mostly a matter of waiting, rather than coming up with any particular challenge. The layouts of the maps reinforces the feeling that the experience is ultimately very similar playthrough to playthrough, with very lite to "discover".
