Whenever I see what seems to be perfectly functioning electronics trashed, I cannot help but wonder: "could that still serve a purpose? Maybe this still has a life in it?". A lot of the time the answer is, simply put: no, there is no life left in it. People often have a legitimate reason for throwing stuff away (i.e. it doesn't work), and it's better to err on the side of caution with this brand of dumpster diving (and leave that dumped microwave alone!). Nonetheless, I find things like gamepads, microcontrollers, [[My old phone is my new server|old phones]] and such the most interesting targets when it comes to turning trash into treasure.

Guided by these ponderings, I dug into a dumpster outside my student dorm on an autumn afternoon in 2017 and fished out a metallic box with a tangle of wires dangling from it, and a dusty air about it. Thinking it a computer, I tore into it and cracked open its silvery, undecorated surface, only to find the case mostly empty - disregarding the thick layer of dust and birch seeds the covered most surfaces inside, the only things beneath the case were four silicon boards screwed to the bottom with some pretty massive heat sinks.

With a bit of investigation, I soon learned that what I had picked up was an old ___ brand bitcoin miner. The massive heatsinks provided cooling for the dedicated asic chips and my theory was that the birch seeds had ended up inside the case when it the miner was ran outside, perhaps on a balcony, for cooling. I ended up tossing most of the miner into the nearest e-waste bin, but not before I had salvaged a stripped down, but functional Beaglebone Black from the miner. In its past life it had been used to coordinate the asics and their hashing tasks, but liberated from its silvery prison, this beagle was looking at a cozy retirement living indoors and running some simple services for my local network.
